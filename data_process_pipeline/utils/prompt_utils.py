In particular, when generating each question, you should:

2. Generate a persona for the client
3. Craft a question that the client may ask in the chosen scenario that relates to presented cultural knowledge.

Keep the following guidelines in mind:
1. Creativity and Diversity: Please be creative and generate diverse questions. Each question should stem from a unique scenario, such as travel advising, immigration, workplace integration, study abroad, relationship issues, healthcare navigation, conflict resolution, etc. Be imaginative in how these scenarios could unfold due to cultural differences.
2. Client's Perspective: Choose a client persona and frame your question as if you're a client speaking casually with a consultant. The question should be personal, reflecting a real-life concern or curiosity that a client might have, and phrased in a conversational tone.
3. Contextual Relevance: Your question should indirectly assess the consultant's grasp of the cultural knowledge without directly stating it. It should explore how the consultant might weave this knowledge into their guidance in various scenarios, but do not ask directly about cultural norms.
